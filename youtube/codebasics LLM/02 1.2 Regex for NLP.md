### Key Points

#### 1. 🤖 Customer Service Chatbot Use Case  
- Chatbots locate order numbers in user messages using regex pattern matching.  
- Order number patterns include the word "order" followed by non-digit characters and then a sequence of digits.  
- Phone numbers can appear in two formats: `(123)-456-7890` or a continuous sequence of 10 digits.  
- Email IDs follow the pattern: sequence of characters + `@` + sequence of characters + `.` + domain (e.g., `.com`, `.io`, `.ai`).  

#### 2. 🐍 Python Setup and Tools  
- Python’s built-in `re` module is used for regex operations.  
- Git Bash is recommended for running Unix commands on Windows.  
- Jupyter Notebook is used as the coding environment for writing and testing Python regex code.  

#### 3. 🔍 Regex Basics and Syntax  
- `\d` matches a single digit (0-9).  
- Quantifiers: `{n}` matches exactly n repetitions, `+` matches one or more, `*` matches zero or more.  
- Special characters like brackets `(`, `)`, and dot `.` must be escaped with a backslash `\` to be matched literally.  
- The pipe symbol `|` represents OR in regex, allowing matching of alternative patterns.  
- Character classes `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` match letters, digits, and underscore.  

#### 4. 📞 Phone Number Regex Patterns  
- Continuous 10-digit phone number pattern: `\d{10}`.  
- Phone number with brackets and hyphens pattern: `\(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4}`.  
- Combined pattern using OR: `\d{10}|\(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4}` matches both formats.  

#### 5. 📧 Email Regex Pattern  
- Email username pattern includes letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscore `_`: `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+`.  
- Domain pattern includes letters and digits: `[a-zA-Z0-9]+`.  
- Domain extension pattern includes `.com`, `.io`, `.ai` etc., matched as `\.(com|io|ai)`.  
- Full email regex example: `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.(com|io|ai)`.  

#### 6. 🛒 Order Number Extraction Pattern  
- Pattern to extract order number: `order\D*(\d+)`.  
- `\D*` matches any number of non-digit characters between "order" and the digits.  
- Parentheses `()` capture the digit sequence as a group for extraction.  

#### 7. 🧑‍💻 Information Extraction from Wikipedia Text  
- Age pattern: `age (\d+)` matches the word "age" followed by digits.  
- Name after "born": `born (.*)` captures all characters after "born" until the line ends.  
- Birthdate pattern: `born (.*)\(` captures text after "born" up to the opening bracket.  
- Birthplace pattern: `age.*\n(.*)` captures the line immediately following the age line.  

#### 8. 🧰 Python Regex Function for Extraction  
- `re.findall(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)` returns all matches of a pattern in text.  
- A reusable function can return the first match or `None` if no match is found.  
- Grouping with parentheses in regex allows extraction of specific sub-parts of a match.  

#### 9. 📝 Summary of Regex Use in NLP  
- Regex is essential for extracting structured data from unstructured text in NLP.  
- Many NLP problems can be solved or partially solved using regex without machine learning.  
- Regex patterns can be combined and refined to handle multiple formats and variations.  
- Online tools like regex101.com help in building and testing regex patterns interactively.

## Study Notes



### 1. 🧩 Introduction to Regex in NLP

Regular expressions, or **regex**, are a powerful tool used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to find and extract patterns from text. Think of regex as a way to describe a search pattern — like telling your computer, “Find me all the phone numbers in this text” or “Extract the order numbers mentioned in this chat.”

In NLP, regex is often the first and simplest step to solve many problems. Before jumping into complex machine learning models, regex can quickly and efficiently handle tasks like identifying phone numbers, emails, or specific keywords. Many real-world NLP systems use a **hybrid approach**, combining regex with machine learning to get the best results.

This lecture focuses on two practical use cases:
- A **customer service chatbot** that identifies order numbers, phone numbers, and emails from user messages.
- An **information extraction task** that pulls key details (like age, birthplace) from a person’s Wikipedia text.

You’ll also see how to write Python code using the built-in `re` module to implement regex pattern matching.


### 2. 🤖 Use Case 1: Customer Service Chatbot and Pattern Matching

Imagine you ordered a product online and contacted customer support. Instead of a human, a chatbot replies and instantly recognizes your **order number** from your message. How does it do that?

#### Understanding the Problem

People express the same information in many ways:
- “I have an issue with my order #12345.”
- “My order 12345 is delayed.”
- “There is a problem with my order number 12345.”

Despite the differences, the chatbot needs to identify the **order number** in all these cases.

#### How Regex Helps

Regex can define a **common pattern** that matches all these variations. For example:
- The word **order** appears first.
- Then, there might be some characters (like a hash `#` or the word “number”).
- Finally, a sequence of digits representing the order number.

This pattern can be expressed in regex to **extract the order number** regardless of how the user phrases it.

#### Extending to Phone Numbers and Emails

Similarly, chatbots often ask for phone numbers and emails to verify accounts. These also follow certain patterns:

- **Phone numbers** might be:
  - `(123)-456-7890` (with brackets and hyphens)
  - `1234567890` (a continuous sequence of 10 digits)

- **Emails** generally have:
  - A sequence of characters (letters, digits, underscores)
  - An `@` symbol
  - A domain name (like `gmail.com` or `company.io`)

Regex can be designed to match these patterns, even if users type them in different formats.


### 3. 🐍 Setting Up Python for Regex Coding

To practice regex in Python, you need:

- **Python installed** on your computer.
- A command-line tool like **Git Bash** (for Windows users) or the default terminal on Linux/Mac.
- A coding environment like **Jupyter Notebook** to write and run Python code interactively.

The Python module for regex is called `re` and comes built-in, so no extra installation is needed.


### 4. 🔍 Building Regex Patterns Step-by-Step

#### Matching Digits

- `\d` matches a **single digit** (0-9).
- To match multiple digits, use quantifiers:
  - `\d{3}` matches exactly 3 digits.
  - `\d{10}` matches exactly 10 digits.
  - `\d+` matches one or more digits.
  - `\d*` matches zero or more digits.

Example: To find a 10-digit phone number, use `\d{10}`.

#### Matching Special Characters Literally

Some characters like brackets `(`, `)`, dots `.`, or stars `*` have special meanings in regex. To match them literally, you need to **escape** them with a backslash `\`.

Example:
- To match a literal opening bracket `(`, use `\(`.
- To match a dot `.`, use `\.`.

#### Combining Patterns with OR (`|`)

If you want to match either pattern A or pattern B, use the pipe symbol `|`.

Example:
- To match either a 10-digit number or a phone number with brackets and hyphens:
  ```
  \d{10} | \(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4}
  ```

#### Character Classes and Ranges

- `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter.
- `[A-Z]` matches any uppercase letter.
- `[0-9]` matches any digit.
- You can combine them: `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` matches letters, digits, and underscore.

#### Quantifiers for Repetition

- `*` means zero or more repetitions.
- `+` means one or more repetitions.
- `{n}` means exactly n repetitions.
- `{n,m}` means between n and m repetitions.


### 5. 📞 Extracting Phone Numbers and Emails with Python Regex

#### Phone Numbers

Two common formats:

1. Continuous 10 digits: `\d{10}`
2. `(123)-456-7890` format: `\(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4}`

To match either, combine with OR:

```python
pattern = r"\d{10}|\(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4}"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
```

#### Emails

Basic email pattern:

- Username: letters, digits, underscores (`[a-zA-Z0-9_]+`)
- `@` symbol
- Domain: letters and digits (`[a-zA-Z0-9]+`)
- Dot `.`
- Domain extension: `.com`, `.io`, `.ai` etc.

Example regex:

```python
pattern = r"[a-zA-Z0-9_]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.(com|io|ai)"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
```

This matches emails like `user_123@gmail.com` or `name@company.io`.


### 6. 🛒 Extracting Order Numbers from Chat Text

To extract order numbers from varied user messages, the regex pattern can be:

- Match the word **order**
- Followed by any characters except digits (`\D*`)
- Then capture the sequence of digits (the order number) using parentheses for grouping

Example:

```python
pattern = r"order\D*(\d+)"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
```

Here, `(\d+)` captures the order number as a **group**, so you get just the digits, not the whole matched string.


### 7. 🧑‍💻 Use Case 2: Information Extraction from Wikipedia Text

Google’s knowledge panels show key info about people (age, birthplace, birthdate). How can we extract this info from Wikipedia text?

#### The Challenge

Wikipedia pages are HTML markup, but after scraping and cleaning, you get plain text with patterns like:

- `Age 52`
- `Born June 28, 1971`
- `Birthplace Houston, Texas`

#### Regex Patterns for Extraction

- **Age**: The word “age” followed by a space and digits.

  ```python
  pattern = r"age (\d+)"
  ```

- **Name after “born”**: The word “born” followed by any characters until the end of the line.

  ```python
  pattern = r"born (.*)"
  ```

- **Birthdate**: After “born”, extract the date before the next bracket.

  ```python
  pattern = r"born (.*)\("
  ```

- **Birthplace**: The line after the age line.

  ```python
  pattern = r"age.*\n(.*)"
  ```

#### Using Groups and `findall`

Parentheses `()` in regex create **groups** that capture specific parts of the match. This lets you extract just the useful info (like the number for age or the name string).


### 8. 🧰 Writing Reusable Python Functions for Regex Extraction

To avoid repeating code, you can write a Python function that takes a regex pattern and text, and returns the first match or `None` if no match is found:

```python
import re

def get_pattern_match(pattern, text):
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
    if matches:
        return matches[0].strip()
    return None
```

Then, you can build a function to extract all personal info from a text:

```python
def get_personal_info(text):
    age = get_pattern_match(r"age (\d+)", text)
    name = get_pattern_match(r"born (.*)", text)
    birthdate = get_pattern_match(r"born (.*)\(", text)
    birthplace = get_pattern_match(r"age.*\n(.*)", text)
    
    return {
        "age": int(age) if age else None,
        "name": name,
        "birthdate": birthdate,
        "birthplace": birthplace
    }
```

This function can be used on any text following the same format to extract key details.
