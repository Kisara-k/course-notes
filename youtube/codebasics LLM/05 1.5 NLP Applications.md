### Key Points

#### 1. üè∑Ô∏è Part of Speech (POS) Tagging  
- POS tagging assigns grammatical categories (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence.  
- Nouns represent persons, places, things, or ideas; verbs represent actions or states.  
- Pronouns substitute nouns (e.g., he, she, I).  
- Adjectives describe nouns; adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.  
- Interjections express strong emotions (e.g., wow, alas).  
- Conjunctions connect words or phrases (e.g., and, but, or).  
- Prepositions link nouns to other words, indicating relationships like location or time (e.g., in, on, at).  
- spaCy provides detailed POS tags beyond the basic 8 parts of speech, including proper noun, numeral, article, determiner, etc.  
- spaCy‚Äôs `token.pos_` gives the coarse POS tag; `token.tag_` provides detailed grammatical info like verb tense (e.g., VBD = past tense verb).  
- POS tagging can be used to filter out punctuation, spaces, and irrelevant tokens in text preprocessing.

#### 2. üè¢ Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
- NER identifies and classifies entities in text into categories like person, organization, location, money, product, date, etc.  
- NER helps distinguish entities with the same name but different meanings (e.g., Tesla as a company vs. Tesla as a person).  
- spaCy‚Äôs pre-trained NER model detects entities and labels them (e.g., ORG for organizations, PERSON for people).  
- Capitalization and context affect NER accuracy (e.g., "Twitter" vs. "twitter").  
- spaCy‚Äôs `doc.ents` contains all recognized entities in a text.  
- `spacy.explain()` can be used to get human-readable explanations of entity labels.  
- NER is useful in search, recommendation systems, and customer support automation.

#### 3. üõ†Ô∏è Building Custom NER Systems  
- Simple lookup uses a database of known entities to identify matches in text; it is rule-based and non-ML.  
- Rule-based NER uses patterns or regular expressions (regex) to identify entities; spaCy provides an `EntityRuler` class for this.  
- Machine learning-based NER uses models like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or BERT to learn entity patterns from labeled data.  
- Custom NER can be improved by manually adding or modifying entities using spaCy‚Äôs `Span` class and `set_ents()` method.

#### 4. üßë‚Äçüíª spaCy Practical Details  
- Load spaCy‚Äôs English model with `spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")`.  
- Create a document object with `nlp(text)`.  
- Access tokens and their POS tags with `for token in doc: token.text, token.pos_, token.tag_`.  
- Extract entities with `doc.ents` and print their text and labels.  
- Visualize entities using `displacy.render(doc, style="ent")`.  
- Filter tokens by POS tags to remove punctuation, spaces, or unknown tokens (tagged as 'X').  
- Use `doc.count_by(spacy.attrs.POS)` to count occurrences of each POS tag in a document.

#### 5. üîç spaCy Tagging Details  
- POS tags are coarse-grained categories (e.g., NOUN, VERB, PROPN).  
- Tags (`token.tag_`) provide fine-grained grammatical details (e.g., VBD = past tense verb, VBZ = 3rd person singular present verb).  
- spaCy‚Äôs POS and tag sets include categories like adposition (umbrella term for prepositions and postpositions), punctuation, numeral, and others.  
- Unknown or unclassified tokens are tagged as 'X'.

#### 6. üìà NER Model Limitations and Variants  
- spaCy‚Äôs default NER model may misclassify entities (e.g., confusing person and organization).  
- Capitalization affects entity recognition accuracy.  
- Alternative models like Hugging Face transformers support fewer entity types but may offer different accuracy.  
- Pre-trained models rely on rules and vocabulary learned during training; customization is often necessary for domain-specific entities.


These are the key testable facts extracted from the lecture content.

## Study Notes





### 1. üè∑Ô∏è Part of Speech (POS) Tagging: Understanding the Basics  

#### What is Part of Speech?  
Part of Speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental concept in both English grammar and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves identifying the role each word plays in a sentence. Every word belongs to a category called a "part of speech," such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. Understanding POS is crucial because it helps machines understand the structure and meaning of sentences.

#### Common Parts of Speech Explained  
- **Noun:** Represents a person, place, thing, or idea. For example, in the sentence "Dhaval ate fruits," both "Dhaval" and "fruits" are nouns.  
- **Verb:** Describes an action or state. In the same sentence, "ate" is the verb because it shows the action.  
- **Pronoun:** A substitute for a noun to avoid repetition. For example, instead of saying "Dhaval ate fruits," you can say "He ate fruits." Here, "He" is a pronoun replacing "Dhaval."  
- **Adjective:** Describes or modifies a noun, adding more detail. For example, "many fruits," "sweet fruits," or "red Tesla" ‚Äî "many," "sweet," and "red" are adjectives.  
- **Adverb:** Modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, often describing how an action is performed. For example, "I slowly ate many fruits" ‚Äî "slowly" is an adverb describing the verb "ate."  
- **Interjection:** Expresses strong emotion or sudden exclamation, like "Wow!", "Hey!", or "Alas!"  
- **Conjunction:** Connects words, phrases, or clauses, such as "and," "but," "or." For example, "I want to eat pizza, but I want to be healthy."  
- **Preposition:** Links nouns to other words, showing relationships like location or time. Examples include "in," "on," "at." For example, "Thor is on the bus" ‚Äî "on" links "Thor" and "bus."

#### Why POS Tagging Matters in NLP  
POS tagging helps computers understand sentence structure, which is essential for many NLP tasks like parsing, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. For example, knowing that "play" is a verb and "cricket" is a noun helps a system understand the meaning of "You play cricket."

#### POS Tagging with spaCy  
- **spaCy** is a popular Python library for NLP that provides pre-trained models to perform POS tagging easily.  
- When you input a sentence, spaCy breaks it into tokens (words) and assigns each token a POS tag.  
- spaCy uses detailed tags beyond the basic 8 parts of speech, including subcategories like proper noun (specific names like "Elon"), numeral, article, and more.  
- You can access these tags programmatically and even get explanations for them using `spacy.explain()`.  
- Example: "Elon" is tagged as a proper noun (PROPN), "ate" as a verb (VERB), and "fruits" as a noun (NOUN).  

#### Additional Details: Tags and Tenses  
- spaCy also provides **tags** that give more detailed grammatical information, such as verb tense. For example, "made" is tagged as VBD (verb, past tense), while "quits" is tagged as VBZ (verb, 3rd person singular present).  
- This fine-grained tagging is useful for applications that need to understand verb tense or grammatical nuances.

#### Practical Use Case: Cleaning Text  
- POS tagging can help filter out unnecessary tokens like punctuation, spaces, or unknown tokens (tagged as 'X').  
- For example, when analyzing a company‚Äôs earnings report, you might want to remove punctuation and spaces to focus on meaningful words like nouns and verbs.  
- This cleaning step is often essential before further NLP processing.


### 2. üè¢ Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extracting Meaningful Entities  

#### What is Named Entity Recognition?  
NER is an NLP technique that identifies and classifies key information (entities) in text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, money amounts, products, and more. It helps machines understand "who" or "what" is being talked about in a text.

#### Real-Life Use Cases of NER  
- **Search:** On news websites, when you search for "Tesla," the system highlights all mentions of Tesla as a company. NER helps distinguish whether "Tesla" refers to the company or the person Nikola Tesla.  
- **Recommendation Systems:** If you read articles about "Elon Musk" or "Hong Kong," NER can identify these entities and recommend similar articles or content related to those entities.  
- **Customer Care:** Automatically identifying entities like course names or product names in customer queries helps route issues to the right support team without manual categorization.

#### How NER Works in spaCy  
- spaCy‚Äôs pre-trained models include an NER component that can detect entities in text.  
- You can extract entities from a document using `doc.ents` and get both the entity text and its label (e.g., ORG for organization, PERSON for person, MONEY for monetary values).  
- Example: In "Tesla is going to acquire Twitter," spaCy recognizes "Tesla" as an organization and "Twitter" sometimes as an organization depending on capitalization and context.  
- spaCy also provides `spacy.explain()` to get human-readable explanations of entity labels.

#### Limitations and Improvements  
- Out-of-the-box NER models are not perfect. For example, spaCy might misclassify "Michael Bloomberg" as a person when it should be an organization or vice versa.  
- Capitalization and context affect recognition accuracy (e.g., "Twitter" vs. "twitter").  
- Different models (like those from Hugging Face) may support fewer or different entity types but can sometimes be more accurate.

#### Customizing NER  
- You can add or modify entities manually using spaCy‚Äôs `Span` class and `set_ents()` method to correct or add entities that the model misses.  
- This is useful when you want to ensure specific terms (like company names) are always recognized correctly.


### 3. üõ†Ô∏è Building Your Own NER System: Approaches  

#### 1. Simple Lookup  
- Maintain a database or list of known entities (companies, locations, drugs, etc.).  
- When processing text, check if any words match entries in your database.  
- This is a straightforward, rule-based approach that doesn‚Äôt require machine learning.  
- Pros: Easy to implement, fast, and effective for well-defined vocabularies.  
- Cons: Doesn‚Äôt handle new or unseen entities well.

#### 2. Rule-Based NER  
- Define patterns or rules to identify entities. For example, if a word is capitalized and followed by "Inc," it‚Äôs likely a company.  
- Use regular expressions (regex) for patterns like phone numbers or dates.  
- spaCy provides an `EntityRuler` class to help create and manage these rules.  
- Pros: More flexible than simple lookup, can capture complex patterns.  
- Cons: Requires manual rule creation and maintenance.

#### 3. Machine Learning-Based NER  
- Use statistical or deep learning models to learn entity patterns from labeled data.  
- Common techniques include Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and transformer-based models like BERT.  
- These models generalize better and can recognize new entities based on context.  
- Cons: Requires annotated training data and computational resources.


### 4. üßë‚Äçüíª Practical Coding with spaCy: POS Tagging and NER  

#### Setting Up spaCy  
- Install spaCy and download the English model (`en_core_web_sm`).  
- Load the model in Python and create a `doc` object by passing a sentence or text.  
- Iterate over tokens to access POS tags (`token.pos_`) and detailed tags (`token.tag_`).  
- Use `spacy.explain()` to get readable explanations of tags and entity labels.

#### Extracting and Visualizing Entities  
- Use `doc.ents` to get all entities in the text.  
- Print entity text and labels to understand what spaCy recognized.  
- Use `displacy.render()` to visualize entities in a colorful, interactive way.

#### Filtering Tokens by POS  
- You can filter out unwanted tokens like punctuation, spaces, or unknown tokens by checking their POS tags.  
- This helps clean text for further analysis or model training.

#### Counting POS Tags  
- spaCy provides a convenient API to count occurrences of each POS tag in a document.  
- This can be useful for text analysis, such as finding how many nouns or verbs appear in a report.


### 5. üìö Additional Resources and Exercises  

- The lecture encourages practicing by extracting nouns and numbers from real-world texts like news stories.  
- Exercises help reinforce understanding of POS tagging and NER.  
- The instructor provides GitHub repositories and encourages contributions to build a community learning resource.  
- For deeper understanding of English grammar, many tutorials are available online, but the focus here is on applying these concepts in NLP.


### Summary  

This lecture covered two important NLP applications: **Part of Speech Tagging** and **Named Entity Recognition**. POS tagging helps identify the grammatical role of each word, which is foundational for understanding sentence structure. NER extracts meaningful entities like people, organizations, and locations from text, enabling powerful applications like search, recommendation, and customer support automation.  

Using spaCy, you can easily perform both tasks with pre-trained models, visualize results, and even customize or build your own NER systems using rule-based or machine learning approaches. These skills are essential for anyone working with text data in NLP.
