## Study Notes

### 1. üß© Introduction to Functional APIs in Keras

When building neural networks in Keras, there are two main ways to define models: the **Sequential API** and the **Functional API**. The Sequential API is straightforward and works well for simple, linear stacks of layers. However, it becomes limiting when you want to build more complex architectures like models with multiple inputs or outputs, shared layers, or non-linear connections.

The **Functional API** is a more flexible and powerful way to define models. It allows you to explicitly define the flow of data through layers by treating layers as functions that transform tensors (multi-dimensional arrays). This approach lets you build complex architectures by connecting layers in arbitrary ways.


### 2. üèóÔ∏è Building Models with the Functional API: Step-by-Step

#### Defining Inputs

In the Functional API, you start by defining an **Input layer**. This layer specifies the shape of the input data your model will receive. For example, if you have grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, you define:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input
input_layer = Input(shape=(28, 28))
```

This `input_layer` acts as a placeholder for the input data.

#### Connecting Layers

Next, you define layers and connect them by calling them as functions on the input or previous layers. For example:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense

x = Flatten()(input_layer)  # Flatten the 28x28 image into a 784-length vector
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)  # Fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation
predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)  # Output layer with 10 neurons for classification
```

Each layer takes the output of the previous layer as input and returns a new tensor.

#### Creating the Model

Finally, you create the model by specifying the inputs and outputs:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

func_model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=predictions)
```

This model can now be compiled and trained like any other Keras model.


### 3. üîÑ Comparing Sequential and Functional APIs

The **Sequential API** is simple and intuitive for linear stacks of layers:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense

seq_model = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

But the **Functional API** is more flexible and can handle:

- Models with multiple inputs and outputs
- Models with shared layers
- Models with complex topologies (e.g., branching, merging)


### 4. üîÄ Complex Architectures: Branching and Merging Layers

One powerful feature of the Functional API is the ability to create models where layers branch out and merge back together.

For example, starting from one layer, you can create multiple parallel layers:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Concatenate

layer1 = Dense(32)(x)
layer2_1 = Dense(32)(layer1)
layer2_2 = Dense(32)(layer1)
layer2_3 = Dense(32)(layer1)
layer2_4 = Dense(32)(layer1)

merged = Concatenate()([layer2_1, layer2_2, layer2_3, layer2_4])
```

Here, `layer1` feeds into four separate Dense layers, and their outputs are concatenated (joined) into a single tensor. This kind of architecture is useful for models that need to process information in parallel paths and then combine the results.


### 5. üî¢ Models with Multiple Outputs

The Functional API also allows you to define models that produce multiple outputs. This is useful in multitask learning, where a single model predicts several targets simultaneously.

Example:

```python
input_layer = Input(shape=(num_features,))
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)

y1_output = Dense(1, name='y1_output')(x)  # First output
x2 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
y2_output = Dense(1, name='y2_output')(x2)  # Second output

model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[y1_output, y2_output])
```

Here, the model has one input but two outputs, each predicting a different target.


### 6. ü§ù Siamese Networks: Comparing Two Inputs

A **Siamese network** is a special type of neural network architecture designed to compare two inputs and determine how similar or different they are. It is widely used in tasks like face verification, signature verification, and one-shot learning.

#### Key Idea

- The network has two identical branches (called the **base network**) that share the same weights.
- Each branch processes one input (e.g., two images).
- The outputs of the two branches are compared using a distance metric (often Euclidean distance).
- The network learns to output a similarity score based on the distance between the two processed inputs.

#### Defining the Base Network

The base network is a standard feedforward network that extracts features from an input:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout

def initialize_base_network():
    input = Input(shape=(28, 28))
    x = Flatten()(input)
    x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
    x = Dropout(0.1)(x)
    x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
    x = Dropout(0.1)(x)
    x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
    return Model(inputs=input, outputs=x)
```

This network converts an input image into a feature vector.

#### Using the Base Network Twice

We create two input layers for the two images:

```python
input_a = Input(shape=(28, 28))
input_b = Input(shape=(28, 28))
```

Then, we apply the same base network to both inputs:

```python
base_network = initialize_base_network()
vect_output_a = base_network(input_a)
vect_output_b = base_network(input_b)
```

Because the base network is shared, it ensures the same feature extraction process is applied to both inputs.

#### Calculating the Distance Between Outputs

To measure similarity, we calculate the Euclidean distance between the two output vectors:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Lambda
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def euclidean_distance(vects):
    x, y = vects
    sum_square = K.sum(K.square(x - y), axis=1, keepdims=True)
    return K.sqrt(K.maximum(sum_square, K.epsilon()))

def eucl_dist_output_shape(shapes):
    shape1, shape2 = shapes
    return (shape1[0], 1)

distance = Lambda(euclidean_distance, output_shape=eucl_dist_output_shape)([vect_output_a, vect_output_b])
```

This layer outputs a single value per pair, representing how far apart the two feature vectors are.

#### Final Siamese Model

The model takes two inputs and outputs the distance:

```python
model = Model([input_a, input_b], distance)
```


### 7. ‚öôÔ∏è Training the Siamese Network

The Siamese network is trained using a **contrastive loss function**, which encourages the network to output small distances for similar pairs and large distances for dissimilar pairs.

Example training code:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop

rms = RMSprop()
model.compile(loss=contrastive_loss, optimizer=rms)

model.fit([tr_pairs[:, 0], tr_pairs[:, 1]], tr_y,
          epochs=20,
          batch_size=128,
          validation_data=([ts_pairs[:, 0], ts_pairs[:, 1]], ts_y))
```

- `tr_pairs` contains pairs of training inputs.
- `tr_y` contains labels indicating whether pairs are similar or not.
- The model learns to minimize the contrastive loss, improving its ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs.


### Summary

- The **Functional API** in Keras is a flexible way to build complex models by explicitly defining inputs, layers, and outputs.
- It supports models with multiple inputs and outputs, branching, merging, and shared layers.
- **Siamese networks** use the Functional API to build twin networks sharing weights, comparing two inputs via a distance metric.
- The Euclidean distance is commonly used to measure similarity between feature vectors.
- Training Siamese networks involves specialized loss functions like contrastive loss to learn meaningful similarity measures.
