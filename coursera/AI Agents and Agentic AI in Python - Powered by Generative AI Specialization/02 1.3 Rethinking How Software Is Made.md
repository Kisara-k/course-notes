## 3 Rethinking How Software Is Made



### Key Points



#### 1. ü§ñ AI Agents and Problem Solving  
- Generative AI should be used to solve problems that are currently impossible or intractable without it.  
- AI agents can use richer inputs such as photographs, audio, and conversations, not just rigid, fixed data.  
- A tool for an AI agent can be as simple as a highly specialized prompt that enables new capabilities.

#### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Future of Software Building  
- Traditional software development is slow and often results in software that does not fully meet user needs.  
- Generative AI allows users to build applications by providing natural language instructions and data, without coding.  
- Example: Uploading a travel policy and a receipt to ChatGPT can automatically audit compliance with the policy.  
- Example: A vision-based inventory management system can be created by simply prompting AI with photos and instructions, achievable in minutes rather than years.

#### 3. üåà Hallucination as Computation  
- Hallucination in generative AI is the creation of new, sometimes fictional, content and is a new form of computation, not just a flaw.  
- AI can invent entirely new languages and translate phrases into them, a task previously impossible for computers.  
- Asking AI for multiple perspectives or options (rather than a single answer) leverages hallucination to enhance learning and decision-making.  
- AI can generate conflicting interpretations of data to help overcome human confirmation bias.  
- AI can identify ambiguities in meeting transcripts to improve team communication, even if some hallucination occurs.

#### 4. üìä New Data Access and Extraction  
- Generative AI can extract and use data from unstructured sources like images and PDFs without needing structured databases.  
- Example: AI can create a lunch order from a photo of a catering menu without pre-existing data formatting.  
- AI can provide step-by-step instructions for using unfamiliar devices by analyzing photos, replacing the need for manuals or databases.  
- This flexibility transforms how and when data can be accessed, making information available contextually and on demand.

## Study Notes





### 1. ü§ñ Building the Impossible with AI Agents

When we think about building software with AI agents, the first important idea is to **think differently about the problems we want to solve**. Instead of using generative AI to recreate things we already know how to do well, we should focus on problems that were previously impossible or extremely difficult to solve.

#### Why rethink problem-solving with AI?

- Traditional software solves problems with fixed, rigid inputs and rules.
- Generative AI allows us to use **richer, more flexible inputs** like photos, conversations, and audio.
- This flexibility means AI agents can handle tasks that were once unimaginable.
- Even a simple tool for an AI agent, like a very specialized prompt, can unlock new capabilities.

#### What does this mean for AI agents?

- We need to **expand what we consider as input** to our systems.
- Instead of just numbers or text, AI can now understand and work with complex, real-world data.
- This opens the door to building AI agents that are much more powerful and creative.

#### The future of computing with generative AI

- Generative AI will transform computing by enabling new ways to interact with data and solve problems.
- The key is to **think creatively about how to build AI agents** and what tools they use.
- This shift will allow us to tackle challenges that were once thought impossible.


### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Rethinking How We Teach Innovation and Build Software

Traditionally, building software involves hiring developers who spend weeks or months coding based on a set of requirements. This process is often slow, expensive, and frustrating because the final product may not meet expectations.

#### How is this changing?

- Generative AI makes building applications **much more accessible and user-friendly**.
- Instead of relying on specialized software engineers, **anyone can create powerful applications** by simply describing what they want.
- Innovation will happen "at the edge" ‚Äî meaning the people who actually use the software will be the ones building and improving it.

#### Real-world examples:

1. **Policy auditing software**  
   - Imagine a 17-page travel expense policy PDF.
   - By uploading this policy and a rental car receipt to ChatGPT, the AI can automatically check if the receipt complies with the policy.
   - This would normally take a team of engineers months or years to build.
   - Now, anyone can create such software by just providing the policy and the data to check.

2. **Inventory management for personal collections**  
   - A child who collects shoes can take photos of his shoes.
   - By prompting ChatGPT, he can create an inventory system that identifies the shoes, describes their condition, and estimates prices.
   - This system is more sophisticated than what many engineering teams could build ‚Äî and it took just a couple of sentences to set up.

#### What does this mean for innovation?

- The barrier to building software is dramatically lowered.
- People need to **learn new ways to think about problem-solving with AI**.
- Software development becomes more about **designing prompts and workflows** than writing code.
- This democratizes innovation, empowering more people to create useful tools.


### 3. üåà Hallucination: A New Form of Computing

One of the most misunderstood aspects of generative AI is "hallucination" ‚Äî when the AI generates information that isn‚Äôt factually accurate or real.

#### What is hallucination?

- Hallucination is when AI **creates new content that may not be true or based on real data**.
- Traditionally, this was seen as a flaw or problem.
- But this lecture reframes hallucination as a **new and valuable form of computation**.

#### Why is hallucination important?

- It allows AI to **imagine, create, and explore possibilities** beyond existing data.
- For example, AI can invent a completely new language based on stacking rocks and translate English phrases into it.
- This kind of creative translation was impossible for computers before.

#### How to use hallucination effectively?

- Instead of asking AI for a single "correct" answer, ask for **multiple perspectives or options**.
- Example: If you‚Äôre camping and want to bake a cake with limited tools, ask AI for three different methods and compare them.
- This approach helps you **learn, explore, and make better decisions**.
- It also helps combat human biases by generating **conflicting interpretations** of data, encouraging deeper thinking.

#### Hallucination in collaboration

- AI can analyze meeting transcripts and identify **potential ambiguities or gaps** in communication.
- Even if the AI "hallucinates" some points, it prompts humans to clarify and improve understanding.
- This enhances teamwork and communication rather than replacing human judgment.


### 4. üìä New Ways to Access and Extract Information

Generative AI is changing how we think about data ‚Äî not just what data is, but how we get and use it.

#### Traditional data handling

- Previously, data had to be **structured, formatted, and carefully curated** to be useful.
- We relied on databases, indexes, and rigid query systems.

#### How generative AI changes this

- AI can extract useful information from **unstructured data** like photos, PDFs, or audio.
- Example: Taking a photo of a catering menu and asking AI to create a lunch order for 15 people.
- The AI understands the menu from the image and generates a suitable order without needing a formal database.

#### Real-world convenience

- Imagine being in a hotel room with a confusing coffee maker.
- By snapping a picture and asking AI how to use it, you get step-by-step instructions instantly.
- This replaces the need to search through manuals or databases.

#### What this means for data and computing

- Data can be accessed **anytime, anywhere, and in any format**.
- This flexibility transforms how we interact with information.
- It‚Äôs like having instant, contextual knowledge available on demand ‚Äî similar to sci-fi scenarios where knowledge is "downloaded" directly into your brain.


### Summary

This lecture challenges us to rethink software development and computing in the age of generative AI. The key takeaways are:

- Focus on **solving new, previously impossible problems** with AI agents.
- Empower users to **build software themselves** using natural language and AI tools.
- Embrace **hallucination as a creative computational tool** rather than a flaw.
- Rethink data as **flexible, unstructured, and accessible in new ways**.

Together, these ideas point to a future where software creation is more creative, inclusive, and powerful than ever before.
